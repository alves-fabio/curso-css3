                    Why did the scarecrow win an <a href="https://www.linguee.com.br/ingles-portugues/traducao/award.html" target="_blank">award</a>? Because he was outstanding in his field! What do you call a fish with no eyes? Fsh. Parallel lines have so much in common. It's a shame they'll never meet. I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands. How do you organize a space party? You "planet"!Did you hear about the mathematician who's afraid of negative numbers? He'll stop at nothing to avoid them. Why did the bicycle fall over? Because it was two-tired. What do you call a cheese that's not yours? Nacho cheese! Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything. What do you call a snowman with a six-pack? An abdominal snowman. How do you make a tissue dance? You put a little boogie in it. I told my wife she was drawing her eyebrows too high. She looked surprised. Did you hear about the claustrophobic astronaut? He just needed a little space. Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts. What did one wall say to the other wall? "I'll meet you at the corner!"Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field! What do you call a fish with no eyes? Fsh. Parallel lines have so much in common.
